Modal Project with JS

This is continuation of 100 JS challenges I managed to find on net. So, biggest problem here was that I had no idea
what MODAL is. After researching and after finding how to create modal image on w3schools, I decided to adapt their solution.
Adapt as in, change all that was provided as solution on their website. Mostly because I was doing modal part on the
project that already had logic and defined layout, which meant I needed to change things.

Does it work? Yes, it works. Am I satisfied with the amount of work I put? From logical side of the project,
this was not hard, from esthetic side, I am still struggling and I am forced to google solutions.
At least, I don't have problems implementing solutions and adapting them.

Anyway, this is first project I did after quite sometime, so I will focus more on 
100 Daily UI challenges with occassional JS challenge with React - Redux - MobX projects that I have ongoing.
I did get down after multiple rejected job offers but, I am back in the game now!

Onward to another project!!!
